# bableTalk

**bableTalk** is a real-time multilingual chat application built with **React**, **Node.js**, **Express**, **Socket.io**, **JWT**, and **MongoDB**.  
It allows users to chat in their own language while messages are automatically translated for the recipient.  
This makes it easy for people from different countries to communicate seamlessly.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub  
2. Go to the `server` folder and create a `.env` file with the following variables:  
   - `MONGO_URI`: your MongoDB connection string  
   - `TOKEN_SECRET_KEY`: your JWT access token secret key  
   - `REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET_KEY`: your JWT refresh token secret key  
   - `TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN`: access token expiration time (e.g. "15m", "1h")  
   - `REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRES_IN`: refresh token expiration time (e.g. "7d")  
   - `TRANSLATION_API_KEY`: your API key for the translation service (example: "9E1tzWakcoSjfrORWD5LTU01xaNtDRLE")  
   - `NODE_ENV`: environment mode (e.g. "production")  
3. Install dependencies in both `client` and `server` folders using npm
